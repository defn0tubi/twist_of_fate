# Twist of fate Discord bot
## How to use
**To start a new game of Twist of Fate, you must have administrator rights on the server you are trying to do so.**

Use `/startgame` to start searching for players to start a new game. All timings are customizable.

Please keep in mind that only 1 game is possible in a channel at a time. If you for some reason want to play multiple games at once, start a new one in another channel.

## Rules
`/rules` to be made
